# Answers to Technical Questions

## How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent approximately several hours completing the coding test. Given more time, I would enhance the solution by:

- Adding user authentication and authorization to secure the CRUD operations.
- Implementing server-side and client-side validation for form inputs.
- Adding pagination and search functionality to the sliders listing page.
- Improving accessibility and adding more detailed ARIA attributes.
- Adding unit and integration tests for backend and frontend components.
- Optimizing image uploads with resizing and compression gzip and HTPP headers.
- Enhancing the slider UI with smoother animations and touch/swipe support for mobile.
- Adding caching mechanisms to improve performance.

## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

To track down a performance issue in production, I would:

- Use application performance monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Blackfire to identify slow transactions and bottlenecks.
- Analyze server logs and database query logs to find slow queries or errors.
- Use profiling tools to measure CPU, memory usage, and response times.
- Reproduce the issue in a staging environment with similar data and load.
- Review recent code changes and deployments for potential causes.
- Optimize database indexes, queries, and caching strategies.
- Monitor network latency and external API calls.
  Yes, I have experience troubleshooting performance issues using these methods in previous projects.
